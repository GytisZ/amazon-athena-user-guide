# Views<a name="views"></a>

A view in Amazon Athena is a logical, not a physical table\. The query that defines a view runs each time the view is referenced in a query\.

You can create a view from a `SELECT` query and then reference this view in future queries\. For more information, see [CREATE VIEW](create-view.md)\.
