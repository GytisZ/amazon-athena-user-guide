# Using Workgroups to Control Query Access and Costs<a name="manage-queries-control-costs-with-workgroups"></a>

Use workgroups to separate users, teams, applications, or workloads, and to set limits on amount of data each query or the entire workgroup can process\. Because workgroups act as resources, you can use resource\-based policies to control access to a specific workgroup\. You can also view query\-related metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, control costs by configuring limits on the amount of data scanned, create thresholds, and trigger actions, such as Amazon SNS, when these thresholds are breached\.
