# Access through JDBC and ODBC Connections<a name="policy-actions"></a>

To gain access to AWS services and resources, such as Athena and the Amazon S3 buckets, provide the JDBC or ODBC driver credentials to your application\. If you are using the JDBC or ODBC driver, ensure that the IAM permissions policy includes all of the actions listed in [AWSQuicksightAthenaAccess Managed Policy](awsquicksightathenaaccess-managed-policy.md)\.

For information about the latest versions of the JDBC and ODBC drivers and their documentation, see [Connect with the JDBC Driver](connect-with-jdbc.md) and [Connect with the ODBC Driver](connect-with-odbc.md)\.
