You can access the AWS Management Console for Amazon Athena here: [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/athena/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home)\.

You can use the console to do the following in Amazon Athena:

+ Create, view, update, and delete tables\. 
+ Filter tables by starting to type their names\.
+ Preview tables and generate CREATE TABLE DDL for them\.

+ Create up to ten queries using different query tabs\.
+ Display query results, save, and export them\.
+ Access AWS Glue Data Catalog,
+ View and change **Settings**, such as view the query result location, configure auto\-complete, encrypt query results\.

The console displays an introductory screen that prompts you to create your first table\. To view your tables, locate them under **Tables** in the left pane\.

 Here's a high\-level overview of the actions available for each table:
